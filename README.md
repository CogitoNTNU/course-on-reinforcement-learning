# Course on Reinforcement Learning
Welcome to the "Course on Reinforcement Learning," a practical educational resource designed to introduce you to the world of reinforcement learning (RL). This course will guide you through the foundational concepts and advanced strategies of RL, using hands-on examples and interactive tasks.

## Overview
You will start with an introduction to the basic principles of RL and progress through to implementing advanced algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQN).

## What You Will Learn
* **Foundations of Reinforcement Learning:** Grasp the basic concepts, terminologies, and problem-solving approaches in RL.
* **Environment and Agent Design:** Understand how to model problems using the RL framework and design agents to interact with environments.
* **Q-Learning with CartPole:** Implement Q-learning to solve the CartPole balancing problem, a classic example in RL.
* **Deep Q-Network Task:** Dive into Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and learn how to apply deep learning to reinforcement learning.
* **Advanced Strategies and Optimizations:** Explore advanced RL strategies and learn optimization techniques for better performance.


## Prerequisites
* Git
* Python 
* A WandB account to be able to watch the learning of weights and biases during training (optional).
